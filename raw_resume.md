* Spearheaded the multi-quarter migration of over 800 repositories from bitbucket to GitHub, coordinating with all teams in engineering to ensure a smooth cut-over, minimizing disruption of daily activities. 

* Founding member of the team tasked with breaking the monolith into micro-services and moving them to the cloud.  Worked on the initial design and roll-out plan that would ensure a seamless migration without compromising developer experience or test coverage. 

* Worked closely with several teams, providing technical guidance on isolation, optimal resource utilization, and monitoring best practices.  Took the feedback from these meetings back to the internal team to ensure a good communication feedback experience to help improve our own tooling. 

* Responsible for onboarding new team members by creating a culture of knowledge transfer, implementing regular knowledge-transfer sessions, pair programming, an inventory of monitoring, logging, and playbooks, to ensure all developers in the team had the same access to information. 

* Identified potential areas where the team could improve our performance and resource utilization, improving our SLOs from 85% to 100%, while reducing the cost. 

* With the learnings from my efforts on resource utilization, I created a set of tools to allow other teams to understand, track, and optimize their resources.  These tools were adopted by several engineering teams, helping the company save money.

* Transformed the quality mindset within the team, taking it from being the explicit job of a quality engineer to a shifted accountability on the entire team, regardless of role. 

* Worked in a team responsible for over 50 micro-services integrating over 15 different platforms in up to 3 different environments.   

* Together with a group of 4 other engineers, wrote the Quality Guidelines for the Financial Engineering division (~150 people) - a list of tenets on how to improve engineering quality while bridging the communication gap between the financial stakeholders and the product team. 

* Representative for diversity and inclusion for the Financial Engineering division inside the Technology Platform Mission (comprised of 500+ people).  Kicked off events to improve the sense of inclusion in the division and designed an onboarding system for new engineers.

* Founding member of the team responsible for continuous integration, responsible for long term vision, team coordination, and implementation of tools and strategies.  As part of this, I had experience developing a full E2E stack using Bootstrap, jQuery and ReactJS on the front-end, Python Flask, Celery, and Redis on the server-side, Jenkins and groovy DSL for job orchestration, docker, fabric and puppet for machine deployment, and AWS for VM hosting. 

* Authored plugins on top of our source-code management system (Bitbucket) to improve our developer workflow.  Helped decrease the test framework instability by writing health monitors for our external dependencies, such as our tunnels for web-based testing on the cloud. 

* Owned E2E testing of proprietary telemetry pipeline, A/B experiments framework, Google Analytics integration, and SQS integration.  Created a Google chrome extension to allow the company for real-time monitoring and debugging of the telemetry pipeline.

* E2E owner of voice call stability testing, which involved deep understanding of the cellular stack, as well as constant communication and integration with partners such as Nokia, Qualcomm, AT&T, Verizon.  This critical suite was used as a release gate for several versions of Windows Phone. 

* Responsible for driving performance and responsiveness measures through automation, and telemetry for the phone calls team on phone, tablet, and PC.  Authored dashboards to represent business metrics using big data collected from these telemetry points. 

* Participated in the team that designed a model-based testing approach for increasing code coverage while still leveraging the existing abstraction layers.  This effort was then used by several other teams within Windows Phone. 

* Worked directly with partners (Nokia, Qualcomm) in helping diagnose and analyze failures during integration testing, primarily for camera components.  Also partnered with Nokia to train them on overall testing strategies and methodologies, as well as helping them build an automation framework for Camera and Photos on Windows Phone.  Additionally, created a Camera Acceptance Testing suite and drove the E2E communication efforts critical for release sign-off. 

* Created a data-agnostic automation framework and drove reliability efforts for 3 different releases of Microsoft Dynamics Retail Services and Point of Sale.
